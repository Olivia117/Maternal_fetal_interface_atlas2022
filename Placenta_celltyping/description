Consists of python scripts & notebooks dedicated towards the analysis of control and pre-eclamptic (diseased) placenta analysis using single nuclei RNA-seq data. 


Understanding the order & function of the scripts:

I) Placenta_celltypist_control_predictions_28012022_S1.ipynb:  
Using CellTypist based automated Logistic regression classifiers optimized by the stochastic gradient descent algorithm. 
The notebook will enable preliminary cell annotation prediction using our previous snRNA-seq placenta dataset (SP014 cohort; from 2021 submission) as a 
"training dataset." The test data was newly sequenced early trimester placenta (SP082 cohort; Cellbender filtered for ambient RNA and random barcode swapping). 
It was restricted to only control (first-trimester) test data as the SP136 disease samples were sequenced later in March'22.

II). Placenta_atlas_integration_controls_LV15_280122_S2.py: 
Data harmonization of SP014 (control) & SP082 early first-trimester samples and perform differential marker analysis for cell annotations. 
The analysis was restricted to controls-only because of the earlier availability of these samples (sequenced by January'22). 
The PE samples were integrated later in April'22 since they were sequenced late. The notebook serves as an initial analysis of control villi. 

III). Placenta_scVI_controls_exploratory_celltyping_LV15_S3.ipynb:
Exploratory analysis of the Leiden clusters- using known markers, LDA & qualitative visualization of integration (data structures). 

IV). Placenta_controls_clustering_exploratory_LV15_S4.ipynb: 
Mapping of the Leiden clusters to a cell type/state annotation based on marker analysis of the control villi. 
Note that, certain annotations were refined later based on trajectory analysis and further investigation. 
Notebooks from step III & IV are separately shown for visualizing the ground work went into the analysis.
